# Face Detection Using OpenCV and Streamlit

This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV and Streamlit, allowing users to either open the camera and detect faces in real-time or upload an image and detect faces within it.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/AyushKatre05/Face-detection-Using-OpenCV.git


2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

streamlit run app.py


## Functionality

- **Open Camera:** Click the "Open Camera" button to start the camera and detect faces in real-time. Press 'q' to stop the video stream.

- **Upload an Image:** Alternatively, you can upload an image (in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format) using the file uploader. The application will detect faces within the uploaded image.
